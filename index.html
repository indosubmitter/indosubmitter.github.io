                <p>Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our <code>GOD</code>, the Lord is One! Therefore you shall adore the Lord your <code>GOD</code> with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.</p>
                <p><code>GOD</code>bears witness that there is no deity except He, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge. Truthfully and equitably, He is the absolute deity; there is no deity but He, the Almighty, Most Wise.</p>
                <p>Let us meditate on <code>GOD</code>, His glorious attributes, who is the basis of everything in this universe as its Creator, who is fit to be worshiped as Omnipresent, Omnipotent, Omniscient, and self existent conscious being, who removes all ignorance and impurities from the mind
 and purifies and sharpens our intellect.</p>
